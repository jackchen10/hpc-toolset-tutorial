name: MPI Python Job (Mandelbrot Set)
host: hpc
script: script.sh
notes: |
  MPI Python job template for parallel computation.
  
  This template is designed for running MPI Python scripts that require
  multiple processes across multiple nodes. Perfect for computationally
  intensive tasks like the Mandelbrot set calculation.
  
  Features:
  - Multi-node MPI execution
  - Automatic Python environment setup
  - Required package installation (mpi4py, numpy, matplotlib)
  - Comprehensive logging and error handling
  - Resource allocation for parallel processing
  
  Default configuration:
  - 2 nodes, 4 total tasks (2 tasks per node)
  - 2GB memory per CPU
  - 2 hour time limit
  
  To use this template:
  1. Copy your MPI Python script to the job directory
  2. Rename it to 'mandelbrot_mpi.py' or modify the script.sh accordingly
  3. Adjust resource requirements in script.sh if needed
  4. Submit the job
